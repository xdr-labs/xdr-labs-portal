# Surface Reconciliation Contract

Before release, qualify the exact candidate against the rendered XDR Labs portal browser surface.

- Use a real Chromium/Chrome process against a deployed preview or the public site at https://xdr.ooo.
- Confirm the landing page renders, primary navigation is usable, and representative English/Korean navigation (when present) resolves without a broken page.
- Confirm docs.json navigation/search configuration agrees with the rendered site for the changed area.
- Record candidate SHA, tested URL, browser identity, PASS/FAIL, and evidence location.
- Static JSON/Markdown validation is supporting evidence only and cannot substitute for this surface check.

## Engineering System User Acceptance v2 — mandatory execution semantics

- **ChatGPT itself is the executor and final auditor.** ChatGPT directly acts as the applicable real User/Operator/Admin persona and drives the actual supported public surface. Coding agents, alternate models, wrappers, scripted replays, CI jobs, unit/component/API suites, and static scanners are supporting evidence only and cannot produce Surface Reconciliation PASS.
- Start **capability-first and black-box-first**. The acting persona discovers the product from public help/navigation/controls/output before source/parser/route/test inspection. Implementation knowledge is auditor-only after the corresponding public evidence is frozen.
- Reconcile every applicable capability through public discovery, role/context, terminology, lifecycle, state/empty/error semantics, next action, recovery guidance, risky/destructive-action safety, and user-visible result. Every mandatory capability/public control receives an explicit disposition; FAIL/PARTIAL/BLOCKED/not-run never becomes PASS.
- **A finding is not a stop condition.** Preserve evidence and continue every safe independent scenario. Do not patch product/source/contract during the frozen discovery pass. After safe coverage is exhausted, freeze the complete finding set, remediate it as one bounded batch, and rerun Surface Reconciliation from the beginning on the new candidate.
- For browser products, ChatGPT performs the user action through a real Chromium/Chrome process; browser drivers may control it, but static DOM/API/component evidence cannot substitute.
- Retain exact candidate HEAD, committed contract identity/digest, machine-readable capability/surface/findings ledgers, and a ledger-derived summary. Release PASS requires 100% applicable capability/public-surface coverage, zero mandatory FAIL/PARTIAL/BLOCKED, and zero unresolved blocking finding.
- If the product supports an AI-assisted public user path, run the same applicable user goal through that path using only user-visible information and require semantically equivalent supported guidance/outcome.
